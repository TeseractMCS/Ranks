# Teseract Ranks + Health Indicator!
you will be allowed to have different ranks displayed on the chat and below your name, with also a health indicator that will display your health in current/maximum format.
<h1>Adding and removing ranks</h1>
The only thing you have to do for adding a rank to a player is adding a tag using the /tag command containing the rank name in the following format:tsrank:<rank>, removing the rank is easy, just remove the tag you added previously!
Here you have some examples!
/tag Ikodazer add "tsrank:Survivor"
/tag ElCiBeR2498 add "tsrank:Creator"
The only limit you have with the ranks is your own imagination!

Health indicatorYou can toggle the health indicator with the following command:/scoreboard players set display healthindicator 0/1 (0 for false, 1 for true)
